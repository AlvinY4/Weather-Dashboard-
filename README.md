## User Story

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Description 

I created a weather dashboard using the Open Weather API. It allows users to check the current weather of a desried city by entering the city name in the search bar. It also shows the five day forecast of the city on the bottom of the page. The website also saves your past searches in the localstorage so you can go back to them.
